# Badges!

### What are the badges?
The badges are a complementing tool to the Ladder - while ladder outlines career paths, badges reward behaviors and achievements we respect and appreciate in our team members.

### How can I create a badge?
Simple. Badges must meet the following criteria:
#### 1. Badge achievement must be a measurable, objective and have clear pass-fail criteria.
###### Example: *Good speaker*
Do: Prepared an educative talk for an audience of ~50+ people
Don't: Uploaded a few well-structured presentations

#### 2. A badge must be achievable by one person in a reasonable time
###### Example: *Code Review Knight*
Do: Reviewed 100 pull requests, helping his teammates to get on the right track
Don't: Invested 100 hours in reviewing code

#### 3. Badges must reflect behavior that are contributing to the team, the community and the company
###### Example: *Mentor Mage*
Do: Wrote a resourceful documentation for 10 new features 
Don't: Left several instructions for his team-mates of how to proceed


### What are the badges for?
The Ladder rewards technical excellence alongside effective behaviors and communication skills. It doesn't, however, cover all aspects and abilities one may possess and we should appreciate. Thus, the badges should serve as an additional tool to celebrate accomplishments, despite the fact they don't necessarily lead into a promotion.
