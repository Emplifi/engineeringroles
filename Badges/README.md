The badges are a complement system to the Ladder - while ladder outlines career paths, the badges reward behaviors and achievements we respect and appreciate in our fellows.

##### Example Badge: *Good presenter*
Do: Presented to an audience of at least 50 people

##### Example Badge: *CR Knight*
Do: Performed 1000 code reviews

Don't: Invested 100000 hours reviewing code

##### Example badge: *CR Knight*
Do: Performed 1000 code reviews

Don't: Performed a code review in full plate armor <sup>1</sup>
